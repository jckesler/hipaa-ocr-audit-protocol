# hipaa-ocr-audit-protocol
Awhile back, I needed to build a compliance checklist for the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Rules. I decided that the OCR's HIPAA Audit Protocol would provide the best approach to doing this. Unfortunately, I could only find this embedded on one of OCR's web pages, making it difficult to pull it into a spreadsheet. So I grabbed the HTML and pulled out the relevant bits to make it easier to import into a Google Sheet or Excel. This worked like a charm for me, so I wanted to put it out there for others to use in case it might be helpful.
