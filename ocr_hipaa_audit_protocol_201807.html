This standard is not to be construed to permit or excuse an action that violates any other standard, implementation specification, or other requirement of this subpart.<br />
				(2) Standard: Changes to policies and procedures. (i) A covered entity must change its policies and procedures as necessary and appropriate to comply with changes in the law, including the standards, requirements, and implementation specifications of this subpart or subpart D of this part.

				(iii) A disclosure of PHI where a covered entity or business associate has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.<br />
