# hipaa-ocr-audit-protocol
Recently, I needed to build a compliance checklist for the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Rules. I decided that the OCR's HIPAA Audit Protocol would provide the best approach to doing this. Unfortunately, I could only find the audit protocol embedded on one of OCR's web pages, making it difficult to pull it into a spreadsheet. So I grabbed the HTML and pulled out the relevant bits to make it easier to import into Excel or a Google Sheet. This worked like a charm for me, so I wanted to put it out there in case it might be help someone else out.
